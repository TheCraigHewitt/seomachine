## Strategic Framework

### Internal Linking Goals
1. **User Value**: Help readers discover related helpful content
2. **SEO Value**: Distribute page authority and strengthen topic clusters
3. **Conversion Path**: Guide readers toward high-value pages (pillar, product, tools)
4. **Engagement**: Increase time on site and reduce bounce rate
5. **Topical Authority**: Signal content relationships to search engines

### Link Opportunity Analysis

#### Content Context Mapping
- Read article thoroughly to understand all topics and subtopics covered
- Identify key concepts, products, processes, or tools mentioned
- Note pain points, questions, or challenges discussed
- Flag opportunities for deeper exploration or next steps

#### Reference Material Review
- Check @context/internal-links-map.md for priority linking targets
- Identify which Castos pages align with article topics:
  - **Pillar content** (comprehensive guides on main topics)
  - **Related blog posts** (supporting content on subtopics)
  - **Product pages** (Castos features that solve problems mentioned)
  - **Resource pages** (tools, templates, checklists referenced)
  - **How-to guides** (step-by-step processes mentioned)

### Link Placement Strategy

#### Ideal Link Placement Locations

**1. Contextual Body Links** (Primary Focus)
- Within explanatory paragraphs where topic is discussed in depth
- After introducing a concept that has dedicated content elsewhere
- When mentioning a process that has step-by-step guide
- Where reader would naturally want to learn more
- Near examples or use cases

**2. Introduction Links** (Use Sparingly)
- Link to pillar content when article is subtopic of larger guide
- Reference prerequisite knowledge readers may need
- One strategic link maximum in introduction

**3. Conclusion Links** (Next Steps)
- "Related reading" or "next steps" suggestions
- Link to logical follow-up content
- Product/tool pages as solutions to problems discussed
- 1-2 links maximum in conclusion

**4. List Items** (Natural Fit)
- When listing tools, features, or strategies with dedicated pages
- Each item can link to more detailed explanation
- Excellent for comprehensive coverage

#### Links to Avoid
- ❌ Forced links that don't add value
- ❌ Too many links in one paragraph (max 1-2)
- ❌ Links in every section (feels spammy)
- ❌ Linking to only product/sales pages
- ❌ Repeating same link multiple times
- ❌ Links that interrupt article flow
- ❌ Vague "click here" or "learn more" anchor text

### Anchor Text Optimization

#### Best Practices
1. **Descriptive**: Reader knows exactly what they'll get
2. **Natural**: Flows seamlessly in sentence
3. **Keyword-Rich**: Includes relevant keywords for linked page
4. **Varied**: Don't use same anchor text repeatedly
5. **Appropriate Length**: 2-5 words typically, whole sentence rarely

#### Anchor Text Formulas

**Exact Match** (use sparingly):
- "podcast hosting" linking to podcast hosting page
- Best for: Main product/service pages
- Caution: Don't overuse; can look unnatural

**Partial Match** (most common):
- "choosing the right podcast hosting platform" → podcast hosting guide
- "effective podcast SEO strategies" → podcast SEO article
- Best for: Blog posts and guides

**Branded**:
- "Castos analytics dashboard" → analytics feature page
- "using Castos" → product overview
- Best for: Product features

**Naked URLs** (rarely):
- "Visit castos.com/podcast-hosting"
- Best for: Direct references to specific pages

**Generic** (avoid when possible):
- "click here", "read more", "this article"
- Only acceptable if surrounded by descriptive context

#### Bad vs. Good Examples

❌ Bad: "You can learn more about this topic here."
✅ Good: "Learn more about podcast monetization strategies."

❌ Bad: "Check out this article for more information."
✅ Good: "Our complete guide to podcast analytics covers this in depth."

❌ Bad: Linking "podcast" (too broad/vague)
✅ Good: Linking "podcast editing workflow" (specific, descriptive)

### Link Quantity Guidelines

#### Target Range: 3-5 Internal Links per Article
- **Minimum**: 3 links (feel helpful, not isolated)
- **Optimal**: 4-5 links (strong connectivity without spam)
- **Maximum**: 7 links (only if article is 3000+ words)

#### Distribution
- **Pillar Content**: 1-2 links (high priority pages)
- **Blog Posts**: 2-3 links (related articles)
- **Product/Tools**: 1 link (only if contextually relevant)
- **Resources**: 0-1 link (templates, checklists if mentioned)

### Topic Cluster Awareness

#### Pillar-Cluster Relationship
- If this article is cluster content → MUST link to pillar page
- If this article is pillar content → link to 2-3 cluster articles
- Strengthen topic authority through consistent interlinking

#### Related Content Network
- Link to articles in same topic cluster
- Create web of related content
- Help readers explore topics comprehensively
