**Action**: Optimize existing content

---

#### B. Declining Content

- Can double clicks without ranking improvements

**Scoring Factors**:
- Impressions volume
- CTR gap from benchmark
- Potential click gain
- Current ranking position

**Action**: Improve meta title and description

---

#### D. Trending Topics

**Scoring Factors**:
- Growth rate (% increase)

**Action**: Create new content

---

#### E. Competitor Gaps

**Scoring Factors**:

### 3. Opportunity Scoring System

Each opportunity gets a score (0-100) based on:

**Impact** (0-40 points):
- Potential traffic gain
- Conversion potential
- Business value
- Strategic importance

**Effort** (0-30 points, inverse):
- Time required (less = more points)
- Difficulty level (easier = more points)
- Resources needed (fewer = more points)

**Confidence** (0-30 points):
- Data quality
- Historical success rate
- Competitive analysis
- Trend stability

**Formula**:
```
Opportunity Score = (Impact × 0.5) + (Effort × 0.3) + (Confidence × 0.2)
```

### 4. Prioritization Matrix

Opportunities fall into quadrants:

**DO FIRST** (High Impact + Low Effort):
- Quick wins (position 11-20)
- Low CTR fixes
- Minor content updates

**STRATEGIC PROJECTS** (High Impact + High Effort):
- Comprehensive rewrites
- New pillar content
