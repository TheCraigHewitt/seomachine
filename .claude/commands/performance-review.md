# Performance Review Command

Use this command to analyze content performance data and generate a prioritized queue of content tasks.

## Usage
`/performance-review [days]`

## What This Command Does
1. Fetches data from Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and DataForSEO
2. Analyzes performance trends and opportunities
3. Identifies quick wins, declining content, and growth opportunities
4. Scores and prioritizes all opportunities by ROI
5. Creates actionable task queue with specific next steps
6. Generates comprehensive performance report

## Process

### Data Collection
- **Google Analytics 4**: Traffic, engagement, conversions, and trends
- **Google Search Console**: Rankings, impressions, clicks, CTR by page and keyword
- **DataForSEO**: Competitive rankings, SERP features, keyword metrics

### Opportunity Identification
The Performance Agent automatically identifies:

**Quick Wins** (Highest Priority):
- Keywords ranking positions 11-20 (page 2)
- Closest to page 1 with smallest optimization effort
- Calculated opportunity score based on impressions and position

**Declining Content**:
- Pages losing traffic month-over-month
- Identifies severity and potential causes
- Prioritizes by traffic volume at risk

**Low CTR Opportunities**:
- Pages with high impressions but low click-through rates
- Meta title/description improvements needed
- Calculates potential click gains

**Trending Topics**:
- Queries showing rising search volume
- Early mover advantage opportunities
- Content gaps in growing areas

**Competitor Gaps**:
- Keywords competitors rank for but your company doesn't
- Strategic positioning opportunities
- Estimated traffic potential

### Scoring & Prioritization
Each opportunity receives a score (0-100) based on:
- **Impact** (50%): Potential traffic gain, conversion value, strategic importance
- **Effort** (30%): Time required, difficulty, resources needed
- **Confidence** (20%): Data quality, historical success rate, trend stability

### Report Generation
Creates comprehensive report with:
- Executive summary of performance
- Priority queue (urgent/high/medium)
- Detailed opportunity analysis
- Content health dashboard
- Keyword portfolio status
- Resource allocation recommendations
- Week-by-week implementation roadmap

**From Performance Review â†’ Next Actions**:

1. **Quick Win Identified**: "podcast monetization" at position 13
   ```
   /analyze-existing /blog/podcast-monetization-guide
   /optimize drafts/podcast-monetization-guide.md
   ```

2. **Declining Content**: Article lost 35% traffic
   ```
   /analyze-existing /blog/podcast-equipment-guide
   /rewrite podcast equipment guide
   ```

3. **Low CTR**: High impressions, 2.5% CTR
   ```
   # Use Meta Creator agent output from Performance Report
   # Update meta title and description manually or via CMS
   ```

4. **Trending Topic**: "AI podcast tools" +150% growth
   ```
   /research AI podcast tools
   /write AI podcast tools
   ```

5. **Competitor Gap**: competitor.com ranks #3, your company not ranking
   ```
   /research podcast editing workflow
   /write podcast editing workflow
   ```

## Frequency Recommendations

**Weekly** (Quick Check):
- Review top 3 urgent priorities
- Monitor critical metrics (declining pages, position changes)
- Adjust current work based on new data

**Monthly** (Full Review):
- Complete `/performance-review` analysis
- Assess previous month's actions and results
- Plan next month's content priorities
- Adjust strategy based on trends

**Quarterly** (Strategic Review):
- Long-term trend analysis
- Competitive landscape shifts
- Content portfolio health assessment
- Resource allocation strategy

## Best Practices

### 1. Act on Data Quickly
The biggest gains come from quick wins - prioritize position 11-20 optimizations.

### 2. Track Results
Document what you implement and measure results:
```markdown
## Action Taken (2025-10-15)
- Optimized "podcast analytics" article
- Target: Move from position 13 â†’ 8
- Changes: Added 500 words, improved meta, 3 internal links

## Results (2025-11-15)
- New Position: 9 (improved 4 positions)
- Traffic: +35% (+420 pageviews/month)
- Clicks: +18% (+89 clicks/month)
```

### 3. Don't Ignore Declining Content
Revenue leakage compounds - stop declines before creating new content.

### 4. Balance Quick Wins vs. Strategic Projects
**80/20 rule**: 80% effort on quick wins and optimization, 20% on new strategic content.

### 5. Review Data Freshness
- GA4: Usually next-day data
- GSC: 2-3 day delay typical
- DataForSEO: Real-time API data

Plan reviews accounting for data lag.

## Troubleshooting

### "No data returned"
- Check API credentials in `.env`
- Verify property IDs and site URLs
- Ensure service accounts have proper access
- Check date ranges (some metrics have minimum history)

### "DataForSEO budget exceeded"
- Check `DATAFORSEO_DAILY_BUDGET_LIMIT` in `.env`
- Reduce frequency of checks
- Use cached data when possible (set `CACHE_ENABLED=true`)

### "Performance report too long"
- Reduce `days` parameter for shorter period
- Focus on top opportunities only
- Export to separate file for detailed analysis

### "Recommendations don't match business goals"
- Adjust scoring weights in Performance Agent
- Filter opportunities by topic/keyword
- Manually override priority based on strategy

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Analysis Period
```
/performance-review 90  # Last 90 days for long-term trends
/performance-review 7   # Last 7 days for recent changes
```

### Focus on Specific Content
After full review, drill into specific pages:
```
# From performance review, identify problem page
/analyze-existing /blog/specific-article
/rewrite specific article
```

### Compare Periods
```
# Run monthly to track changes
/performance-review 30   # This month
# Compare to previous report from 30 days ago
```

## Expected Impact

Based on typical results:

**Quick Wins** (Position 11-20 â†’ 5-10):
- Average traffic increase: 40-80%
- Timeframe: 2-8 weeks
- Success rate: 60-70% move to page 1

**Declining Content Updates**:

# Review report: research/performance-review-2025-10-15.md
# Identify top 5 priorities

# Week 1: Quick wins
/analyze-existing /blog/top-quick-win-article
