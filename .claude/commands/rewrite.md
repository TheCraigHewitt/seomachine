# Rewrite Command

Use this command to update and improve existing your company blog posts based on analysis findings.

## Usage
`/rewrite [topic or analysis file]`

## What This Command Does
1. Takes existing blog post content and improvement recommendations
2. Rewrites content with updated information and SEO optimization
3. Maintains original article structure where effective
4. Adds new sections to fill content gaps
5. Updates outdated statistics, examples, and references

## Process

### Pre-Rewrite Review
- **Original Content**: Read the existing article thoroughly
- **Analysis Report**: Review findings from `/analyze-existing` if available
- **Research Brief**: Check if new research brief exists for updated angles
- **Brand Voice**: Verify alignment with current @context/brand-voice.md
- **SEO Guidelines**: Apply latest requirements from @context/seo-guidelines.md
- **Competitive Context**: Understand what's changed in SERP since original publication

### Rewrite Strategy

#### Determine Scope
Based on analysis, classify the rewrite level:
- **Light Update (20-30% changes)**: Fix stats, add keywords, improve meta
- **Moderate Refresh (40-60% changes)**: Restructure sections, expand content, update examples
- **Major Rewrite (70-90% changes)**: New outline, significant expansion, fresh angle
- **Complete Overhaul (90%+ changes)**: Essentially new article on same topic

#### What to Keep
- Sections that are still accurate and comprehensive
- Unique insights or perspectives that remain valuable
- Well-performing structure or formatting
- Examples or case studies that are still relevant
- Internal links that remain appropriate

#### What to Update
- Outdated statistics with current data (note date/source)
- Old screenshots or examples with current versions
- Deprecated terminology or processes
- Missing keywords in headings and body
- Weak or missing meta title/description
- Insufficient internal links

#### What to Add
- New sections to fill competitive content gaps
- Recent industry trends or developments
- Additional examples or use cases
- Better introduction hook if current one is weak
- Stronger conclusion and CTA
- Missing SEO elements (keywords, links, structure)

#### What to Remove
- Deprecated information that's no longer accurate
- Redundant or repetitive sections
- Overly promotional language (if inconsistent with current brand)
- Outdated examples or references
- Fluff or filler that doesn't add value

### Content Structure
Follow same structure as `/write` command:

#### 1. Updated Headline (H1)
- Optimize with primary keyword if not already present
- Refresh if original title is dated or weak
- Maintain original if it's strong and still optimized

#### 2. Refreshed Introduction
- Update hook with current statistics or trends
- Clarify value proposition if needed
- Ensure primary keyword appears in first 100 words
- Make it compelling for today's reader

#### 3. Improved Body
- **Maintain**: Keep effective sections that are still accurate
- **Expand**: Deepen shallow sections with more detail
- **Add**: Insert new sections to cover content gaps
- **Update**: Refresh stats, examples, and references throughout
- **Restructure**: Reorganize if flow can be improved
- **Optimize**: Integrate keywords more naturally if needed

#### 4. Strengthened Conclusion
- Update takeaways to reflect new/expanded content
- Refresh CTA to align with current your company priorities
- End with forward-looking perspective

### SEO Enhancement

#### Keyword Optimization
- **Primary Keyword**: Ensure 1-2% density throughout
- **Keyword Placement**: Add to H2s if missing
- **Semantic Variations**: Use related keywords naturally
- **First 100 Words**: Confirm primary keyword appears early
- **Natural Integration**: Never force keywords unnaturally

#### Internal Linking
- **Review Existing**: Ensure all internal links still work and are relevant
- **Add New Links**: Reference newer your company content published since original
- **Strategic Placement**: Link to pillar content and related articles
- **Anchor Text**: Use keyword-rich, descriptive anchor text
- **Quantity**: Aim for 3-5+ quality internal links

#### External Linking
- **Update Broken Links**: Replace any dead external links
- **Fresher Sources**: Replace old statistics with recent data
- **Authority**: Ensure external links are to credible sources
- **Relevance**: Remove outdated external references

#### Meta Elements
- **Meta Title**: Rewrite if not optimized or compelling

### Quality Assurance

#### Content Accuracy
