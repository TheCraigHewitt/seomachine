- **Naming Convention**: Use lowercase, hyphenated topic slug and current date

Example: `drafts/content-marketing-strategies-2025-10-29.md`

## Automatic Content Scrubbing
**IMPORTANT**: Immediately after saving the article file, automatically scrub the content to remove AI watermarks:

1. Run the content scrubber on the saved file:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('data_sources/modules')
from content_scrubber import scrub_file

# Scrub the file (overwrites with cleaned version)
scrub_file('drafts/[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md', verbose=True)
```

2. This removes:
   - All invisible Unicode watermarks (zero-width spaces, format-control characters, etc.)
   - Em-dashes, replaced with contextually appropriate punctuation

3. The scrubbing happens silently and automatically - no user action required

**Result**: Content is clean of AI watermarks before agents analyze it.
