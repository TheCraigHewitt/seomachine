## Best Practices

### Before Writing
1. **Research first**: Always run `/research` before `/write`
2. **Review context**: Read `brand-voice.md` and relevant `writing-examples.md`
3. **Check keywords**: Verify target keyword in `target-keywords.md`
4. **Plan internal links**: Review `internal-links-map.md` for linking opportunities

### During Writing
1. **Follow the brief**: Use research brief as your outline
2. **Natural keywords**: Integrate keywords naturally, never force them
3. **Add value**: Every section should provide actionable insights
4. **Use examples**: Include real podcast scenarios and use cases
5. **Cite sources**: Link to statistics and data sources

### After Writing
1. **Review agent output**: Read all agent recommendations carefully
2. **Make improvements**: Address high-priority issues before optimizing
3. **Run optimize**: Use `/optimize` for final polish
4. **Self-edit**: Read article as if you're the target reader
5. **Check quality**: Verify all checklist items met

### For Rewrites
1. **Analyze first**: Run `/analyze-existing` to understand scope
2. **Determine strategy**: Light update vs. major rewrite?
3. **Preserve what works**: Keep effective sections
4. **Focus on gaps**: Add what's missing from competitive content
5. **Update everything**: Stats, examples, screenshots, links

## Workflow Examples

# Step 8: Final review and move to published/
# Manual review, then move when ready
```

### Example 2: Updating Existing Content

```

/analyze-existing https://yoursite.com/blog/product-comparison

# Step 2: Review analysis
# Read research/analysis-product-comparison-2025-10-29.md

/analyze-existing https://yoursite.com/blog/post-3

# Review content health scores
# Prioritize rewrites based on:

# - Highest traffic potential
# - Strategic importance
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Maximizing Content Quality
- **Study examples**: Read your `writing-examples.md` before each writing session
- **Use data**: Always include current statistics and cite sources
- **Be specific**: "40% increase" beats "significant improvement"
- **Show, don't tell**: Use real podcast examples and scenarios
- **Answer questions**: Address "People Also Ask" questions from research

### SEO Optimization
- **Keywords early**: Get primary keyword in first 100 words
- **Natural integration**: Read content aloud - if keywords sound forced, rewrite
- **Vary anchor text**: Don't use same anchor text for all internal links
- **Link strategically**: Link to pillar content and related cluster articles
- **Update regularly**: Refresh top-performing content every 6-12 months

### Workflow Efficiency
- **Batch research**: Research multiple topics in one session
- **Follow structure**: Use consistent article structure from `/write` command
- **Address high-priority first**: Fix critical issues before optimizing details
- **Use agents wisely**: Let agents handle analysis, you focus on writing
- **Build templates**: Save commonly used sections for reuse

### Avoiding Common Mistakes
- ❌ Skipping research phase
- ❌ Ignoring brand voice guidelines
- ❌ Forcing keywords unnaturally
- ❌ Forgetting internal links
- ❌ Not citing data sources
- ❌ Publishing without optimization
- ❌ Copying competitor content instead of differentiating

## Maintenance

### Weekly

- Update `target-keywords.md` with new keyword opportunities
- Check for broken links in `internal-links-map.md`

### Monthly
- Review published content performance

## Troubleshooting

- **Solution**: Add more diverse examples to `context/writing-examples.md`
- **Solution**: Reference specific examples when using `/write` command

### "Keyword density too high/low"
- **Solution**: Review `seo-guidelines.md` target density (1-2%)
- **Solution**: Use `/optimize` to get specific keyword placement suggestions
