## Above-the-Fold Rules

### The 5-Second Test
Visitors should understand these within 5 seconds of landing:
1. **What** you offer
2. **Who** it's for
3. **Why** they should care
4. **What** to do next (CTA)

### Required Elements
| Element | Purpose | Guidelines |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Headline | Grab attention | Benefit-focused, <70 chars |
| Subheadline | Clarify value | Expand on headline, 1-2 sentences |
| CTA Button | Drive action | High contrast, action verb |
| Trust Signal | Build credibility | Customer count, rating, or logo |

### Above-the-Fold Don'ts
- No sliders or carousels
- No multiple competing CTAs
- No walls of text
- No autoplay videos with sound
- No navigation that distracts from CTA

## Headline Best Practices

### Headline Formulas That Convert

**Problem-Solution:**
- "Stop [Pain Point]. Start [Desired Outcome]."
- "No More [Problem]. Just [Solution]."

**Benefit-First:**
- "[Achieve Outcome] Without [Sacrifice]"
- "The [Fastest/Easiest/Only] Way to [Outcome]"

**Social Proof:**
- "Join [Number] [Audience] Who [Achieved Outcome]"
- "Why [Number] [Audience] Switched to [Product]"

**Question:**
- "Ready to [Achieve Outcome]?"
- "What if You Could [Desired Outcome]?"

### Headline Testing Checklist
- [ ] Contains the primary benefit
- [ ] Under 70 characters (mobile-friendly)
- [ ] Uses "you" or implies the reader
- [ ] Specific (not vague or generic)
- [ ] Creates curiosity or urgency

### Weak Headlines to Avoid
- "Welcome to [Company]"
- "The Best [Product] Solution"
- "Everything You Need"
- "We Help You [Generic Verb]"
- Starting with "Our" or "We"

## CTA Best Practices

### CTA Text Guidelines

**By Conversion Goal:**

| Goal | Strong CTAs | Avoid |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Trial | "Start Your Free Trial" | "Sign Up" |
| Trial | "Try Free for 14 Days" | "Submit" |
| Trial | "Get Started Free" | "Register" |
| Demo | "Book Your Demo" | "Contact Us" |
| Demo | "Schedule a Call" | "Get in Touch" |
| Demo | "See It in Action" | "Learn More" |
| Lead | "Download the Free Guide" | "Submit" |
| Lead | "Get Instant Access" | "Subscribe" |
| Lead | "Claim Your Copy" | "Send" |

### CTA Button Formula
**[Action Verb] + [Benefit/Object] + [Urgency (optional)]**

Examples:
- "Start" + "Your Free Trial" + "→"
- "Get" + "Instant Access" + "Now"
- "Book" + "Your Demo" + "Today"

### CTA Placement Strategy
1. **Hero CTA** (0-20% of page): Primary, most prominent
2. **Post-Problem CTA** (30-40%): After establishing pain
3. **Post-Proof CTA** (60-70%): After testimonials
4. **Closing CTA** (90-100%): Final push with risk reversal

### CTA Visual Best Practices
- **Color**: High contrast with background
- **Size**: Large enough to tap (44x44px minimum)
- **Whitespace**: Breathing room around button
- **Consistency**: Same style throughout page
- **Mobile**: Full-width on small screens

## Trust Signal Hierarchy

### Strongest (Use First)
1. **Specific Results**: "Grew audience by 300%"
2. **Named Testimonials**: "Sarah M., The Creative Hour"
3. **Customer Count with Context**: "50,000+ customers"

### Strong
4. **Star Ratings**: "4.9/5 on G2"
5. **Media Logos**: "As seen in..."
6. **Customer Logos**: Enterprise/recognizable brands

### Supporting
7. **Awards/Certifications**: "Best in Category 2024"
8. **Partnerships**: "Official Partner"
9. **Security Badges**: For payment/data collection pages

### Trust Signal Placement
| Location | Best Trust Signal |
|----------|-------------------|
| Hero (above fold) | Customer count or rating |
| After problem section | Mini-story with outcome |
| Middle of page | Full testimonials (2-3) |
| Near CTA | Risk reversal statement |
| Footer | Security/privacy badges |
