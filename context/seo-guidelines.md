# SEO Guidelines for Castos Content

This document outlines SEO best practices and requirements for all Castos blog content to maximize organic search visibility and rankings.

## Content Length Requirements

### Target Word Counts
- **Standard Blog Post**: 1,500-3,000 words (target: 2,000-2,500)
- **Pillar Content / Comprehensive Guides**: 3,000-5,000 words maximum
- **How-To Guides**: 1,500-2,500 words
- **News / Updates**: 800-1,200 words (exception to standard)

### Important Length Guidelines
- **Maximum for most articles**: 3,000 words
- **Maximum for pillar content**: 5,000 words
- If a topic requires more than the maximum, break it into a series of related articles
- Aim for the lower end of ranges when possible—concise, focused content often performs better

### Why Length Matters
- Longer content typically ranks higher in search results
- More words = more opportunities for keyword integration and topic coverage
- Comprehensive content earns more backlinks and engagement
- Depth signals expertise and authority to search engines

### Quality Over Quantity
- Don't add fluff just to hit word counts
- Every section should provide genuine value
- Better to have 2,000 valuable words than 3,000 padded words
- **Stay within the maximum word counts**—overly long articles hurt user experience

## Keyword Optimization

### Keyword Research Requirements
Before writing any article:
1. Identify primary target keyword
2. Research search volume and difficulty
3. Analyze top 10 ranking competitors
4. Identify 3-5 secondary/related keywords
5. List LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords

### Keyword Density Guidelines
- **Primary Keyword**: 1-2% density
  - Example: In a 2,000-word article, use keyword 20-40 times
  - Natural integration is critical—never force keywords
- **Secondary Keywords**: 0.5-1% density each
- **LSI Keywords**: Sprinkle throughout naturally

### Critical Keyword Placement
Primary keyword MUST appear in:
- [ ] H1 headline (preferably near the beginning)
- [ ] First 100 words of article
- [ ] At least 2-3 H2 subheadings
- [ ] Last paragraph / conclusion
- [ ] Meta title (within first 60 characters)
- [ ] Meta description
- [ ] URL slug

### Keyword Integration Best Practices
- **Natural language first**: Write for humans, optimize for search engines
- **Use variations**: Don't repeat exact phrase robotically
  - Example: "podcast hosting" → "hosting your podcast" → "podcast host"
- **Question formats**: Include conversational variations
  - "How to start a podcast" vs "starting a podcast"
- **Semantic keywords**: Use related terms to support topical authority
  - For "podcast editing": include "audio editing", "post-production", "editing workflow"

### Keyword Stuffing (Avoid)
❌ "Podcast hosting is important. Podcast hosting helps podcasters. Our podcast hosting platform offers podcast hosting services for podcast hosting needs."

✅ "Podcast hosting is important for creators who want to distribute their show to major platforms. A reliable host ensures your episodes are accessible wherever listeners discover new content."

## Content Structure Requirements

### Heading Hierarchy

#### H2 (Main Sections)
- **4-7 H2 sections** for standard articles

- Can be standalone (readers should understand flow from H2s alone)

#### H3 (Subsections)
- Nested under H2s (never skip from H2 to H4)
- Break complex sections into digestible chunks
- Include keywords where natural
- More specific than H2s

### Article Structure Template
